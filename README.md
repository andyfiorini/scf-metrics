# Simplified CF-Metrics
Simplified cf-metrics, is a mod from the original cf-metrics from MonsantoCo(https://github.com/MonsantoCo/cf-metrics).

It is a more simpler setup, with firehose-nozzle feeding influxdb.  For viewing and alerting, I used grafana.

It works, it is simpler to setup than the original.
